One of the most common causes of delay is congestion in the blockchain. If you are trading from or into a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain please be aware that the chain has seen congestion much more frequently than other chains. 

If you have been waiting for more than 30 minutes, please contact our support via Live Chat or Telegram at t.me/swftcoin."
"What does each of the order status mean?","Below are the four statuses you will encounter once you begin an exchange.
For illustration purposes, we will assume an exchange of ABC to XYZ.

- Transferring: ABC is transferred to our protocol to be exchanged.
- Exchanging: ABC is being exchanged to XYZ
- Confirming: The exchange is waiting to be confirmed and sent to your receiving wallet
- Completed: You should be able to see XYZ in your receiving wallet now."
"How can I view the hash of the transaction? What is transfer in and out hash?","Click your order under ""Transaction Record"".
Transfer Out Hash: Hash of transferring your fund to the system. Copy & paste it in the respective blockchain explorer to view. 

Transfer In Hash: Hash of the system transferring receiving funds to your account. Paste it in the respective blockchain explorer to view. 

Note: Transfer In Hash will not be available until the order is complete."
"Why do I not see the currency I exchanged in my wallet?","There may be multiple reasons for this. Below is a list of common reasons and solutions: 

1.) The transaction is not complete. Under transaction records, you can see your recent transactions. Find the transaction you are looking for and on the left-hand side, you should be able to see the status of the transaction. If it doesn't say ""Completed"" then please wait for a bit longer. 

2.) You do not have native currency in your wallet to pay for gas. Make sure you have respective currency in your wallet to pay for gas. For example, for Etherum blockchain it will be ETH, BNB for BSC, HT for HECO, etc. Note: For cross-chain transactions, you only need gas for sending the currency, not the receiving blockchain. For example, if you are sending from BSC to HECO, you only need gas in BNB for BSC. We cover the gas on HECO as part of the fees. 

3.) You have not added the token to your wallet. For most wallets, you need to manually add tokens to your wallet in order to view their balance. 

4.) You sent the tokens to the wrong address. Please double-check your receiving address. 

5.) Your wallet is on the wrong blockchain. When you make a cross-chain exchange, the tokens you receive will be on a different blockchain. For example, if you are swapping from Token A on HECO to Token B on BSC. Once the exchange is complete, you will have to make sure you are looking at your BSC wallet in order to view Token B. 

6.) If you sent the token to the same address as your original but on a different blockchain it may be possible to create a wallet with the same address on that new blockchain. 

On Metamask, you can simply select ""Add Network"" and add the new blockchain. Make sure to add the token to view the balance!

On TokenPocket, select add wallet on the top right, select Binance Smart Chain, select ""Import"", then ""One-key Sync"", then select the new blockchain, and then select ""Start Syncing"". Once syncing is complete, a new wallet of your original address on the BSC Chain will be created. Make sure to add the token in your new wallet to view the balance!

For other wallets, the process may be similar, please contact their customer service for support."
"Why is the amount that I received different from the amount I submitted?","The rate of exchange is calculated based on the real-time exchange rate at the time of the submission of the order. During the exchange process, the exchange rate is typically changing. We follow the calculation based upon the real-time exchange rate when the trade is conducted, as a result, there may be a small amount of discrepancy in the two numbers. A small fee is also deducted for transactions and gas."
